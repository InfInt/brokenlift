About
-----

* Public transport operators in Europe must ensure that mobility impaired
  people can use their service. That's why more and more lifts are
  installed at train and subway stations. Broken lifts severly restrict
  the freedom of those people. Being stuck at a train platform not only
  makes a journey much longer, it is also disrespectful to the individual.
* BrokenLifts was born at December 3/4, 2011 at
  [Random Hacks of Kindness, Berlin](http://www.rhok.org/event/berlin-germany). There are pictures taken at [RHoK Berlin on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/rhokbln/).
* The [initial project
  description](http://www.rhok.org/problems/brokenelevatorsinfo-%E2%80%93-push-faulty-elevators-next-level-public-awareness-deen)
  can still be found online.
* The project idea was brought to RHoK by Raul Krauthausen from
  [Sozialhelden e.V.](http://sozialhelden.de)
* The current version of the website is online at: [http://brokenlifts.heroku.com](http://brokenlifts.heroku.com).
